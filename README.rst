Acknowledgements

This project attempts to collect the efforts put into different forks of the
`pyrocksdb`_ project that was originally written by `stephan-hof`_, as sadly
none seems to be actively maintained. In particular, the `python-rocksdb`_ fork
created by `twmht`_, but it also incorporates changes from other forks and
unfinished pull requests. The current state of this project has pulled all of
these commits from `NightTsarina`_'s `fork`_.
